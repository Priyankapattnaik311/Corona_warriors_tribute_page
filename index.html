	 		Thus "Hanumanism" epitomises selfless service beyond the call of duty. And that is the quality that has been displayed by the "corona warriors" in India, during the countryâ€™s battle against SARS-CoV-2. One of the appellations of Hanuman is sankata mochan (one who relieves you from trouble). That is the way most of us have appreciated all those who have come to our aid during the havoc caused by COVID-19.
           First came the doctors, nurses, ward boys, pathologists, pharmacists and their ilk. As stricter norms came to be implemented, the policemen came to the fore. With the lockdown, the providers of essential supplies made their presence felt: milk, vegetables, grocery, newspaper, water, electricity, telecommunication and banking among others. To stem the exodus of migrant labour, the good Samaritans sprung up from every nook and corner and started kitchens to feed the needy.
